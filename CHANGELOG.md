# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Passkey support:** ES256, Ed25519 and RS256 credential types, selection upon passkey creation based on the relying party's preference order
- Android Credential Manager integration: handling passkey creation and authentication requests from browsers and native apps

## [1.16.4] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Search result filter options "exact match" and "fuzzy" in Settings --> General
- PGP Manager now imports all keys from multi-key backups, such as those produced with OpenKeychain (previously, only the first key was imported)
- Option to generate Ed25519 SSH keys restored

### Changed

- When moving files or directories, conclude action with listing the content of the destination directory
- Improved app behaviour during password repo export and import; a modal dialog is shown until the process completes

### Fixed

- Accidental overwriting of existing password items of same file name after editing
- Empty preference value after fresh install for PIN/biometrics expiration timeout may cause the app to crash

## [1.16.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- The host key fingerprint is displayed when connecting to the Git server for the first time, so that the user can decide whether to establish the connection
- Diceware passphrase generator options for capitalising words and embedding a numeral
- Floating sync button on the password list that is shown if there are local commits to be pushed to remote
- Enhanced folder selection when moving password items, allow navigating upwards, floating button for creating new subfolder

### Fixed

- Keystore-provided SSH keys are usable again
- Allow empty passphrase on Git authentication via PGP key
- Autofill support for Chrome/Chromium browser
- Password entry creation after first successful login (autofill-save)

## [1.16.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Key parsing prematurely stopped on revoked key

## [1.16.1] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Keystore-provided SSH keys option disabled after Play Services update; available SSH public-key authentication options are PGP key and imported SSH key

### Fixed

- Raise Java version in the toolchain to v21 for f-droid
- Sensitive extra content fields mark-up using asterisk-notation did only work with lowercase keys

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- PGP key option for authenticating and connecting via SSH. The PGP key does not need to provide a dedicated authentication subkey; the signing subkey and even the primary certification key are equally usable for that purpose. Of course, the authentication key is always picked first, if available, while the signing subkey and the primary key only serve as fallback keys
- The PGP key manager now lets you set individual passphrases for the subkeys of a PGP key
- Declare sensitive fields of extra content by adding asterisks around keys

      *key 1*: sensitive content

  or by using `gopass` syntax

      unsafe-keys: key 2, key_3, ...
      key 2: something
      key_3: more stuff
      ...

  Such fields will be displayed like password fields with masked content. Search for keys listed in the `unsafe-keys` entry is case-insensitive
- Allow custom port setting for Git via http

### Fixed

- App crashed when dealing with expired PGP keys. From now on, password items can be decrypted and displayed even after the key has expired, but they can no longer be edited, and no new items can be created
- Handling of password items that were encrypted to multiple subkeys
- Enhanced feedback on encryption/decryption success and PGP key availability
- Extra content: strip leading whitespace when copied to clipboard but preserve indentation of multiline text; append newline character at last line
- SSH key parsing and connection failures after a recent system update

## [1.15.4] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed

- Issue #589 fixed: password is inadvertently overwritten if "Edit password" screen is left via Copy&Save button

## [1.15.3] - 2025-11-21

### Added

- Optional caching of Git credentials
- Biometrics and PIN for fast unlocking of passwords expire after a configurable number of days after last successful usage. Default is 3 days, but the validity period can be set to infinity, if desired

### Fixed

- App crashed when trying to enter a proxy URL in Settings --> Repository --> HTTP(S) proxy settings
- Handling of "stripped" PGP keys (passphrase changing and verification)

### Changed

- Make `work/example.org(.gpg)` the default password directory structure for fresh installs
- Autofill: strict domain search setting ("phishing-resistent search") made persistent

## [1.15.2] - 2025-09-05

### Fixed

- Exported PGP keys are now usable as OpenKeychain key backups
- Several edge-to-edge view issues on Android 15 devices

## [1.15.1] - 2025-08-15

### Added

- Password store and new folders can be initialised with multiple PGP keys, if desired
- Quick Settings tile for starting APS in search mode
- Support for chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com SSH cipher

### Fixed

- Invisible "Copy" icon at the end of field items on password UI
- Extra content lines with the same `label:` in the first column were dropped, except the last line. Now, such lines are shown in a common text box, which is useful for saving configuration files as APS items

## [1.15.0] - 2025-07-11

### Added

- In-app creation of PGP keys in the key manager
- Menu options for PGP key export/backup and for changing the PGP key passphrase

### Fixed

- Navigation icon colour adapting to current app theme (light/dark)

## [1.14.5] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed

- Password repo export to and import from an external directory happened to be incomplete if the user returned to the password list too quickly while the operation was still running in the background
- Fast unlocking of password items: The PIN verification attempt counter was reset to zero upon cancelling the dialog or app restart. It is now persistently cached to prevent brute force attempts on the PIN
- Decryption may fail in a multi-key setup, where some PGP keys listed in `.gpg-id` are public-only keys

## [1.14.4] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- An option for fast unlocking password store entries with a PIN was added. Available unlocking options can be accessed via Settings --> Passwords --> Fast unlocking of entries. The PIN is specific to the app, that is, it may differ from the device PIN
- Importing a symmetrically encrypted PGP secret key file, such as an OpenKeychain backup. This allows for more secure handling of PGP keys outside trusted environments, e. g. for key transfer between devices using e-mail or online storage services

## [1.14.3] - 2025-04-25

### Changed

- Adjust Java version to v17 in GitHub workflows to comply with F-Droid requirements

## [1.14.2] - 2025-04-24

### Fixed

- Re-enable pre-launch biometric auth option on Android-14 devices (<https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store/issues/2802>)
- More reliable detection of AES key invalidation due to fingerprint enrollment

## [1.14.1] - 2025-04-16

### Added

- Detect enrollment of a new fingerprint since last app use and inform the user about it; this counteracts the attempt of a potentially malicious user to add their fingerprint unnoticed to the device lock settings

### Fixed

- With biometric authentication at app launch, the biometric prompt was immediately hidden, requiring the user to reopen the app before it could be finally unlocked
- Fix app launch with biometric authentication in case of missing fingerprint

### Changed

- Allow device PIN authentication for SSH and Git operations

## [1.14.0] - 2025-04-09

### Added

- Display user ID (or user IDs in case of multi-key encrypted entries) on the passphrase input dialog
- Allow setting a subdirectory PGP key when creating folders (restored feature from v1.11.0)
- External repository import. An external "pass" repository or a repository previously exported from the app can now be imported via Settings --> Repository --> Import repository
- Copy OTP to the clipboard during autofill: If the pass entry contains an OTP, it is copied to the clipboard to facilitate autofill. The OTP in the clipboard is refreshed once when the first copy expires. This is to handle the situation when the first OTP was calculated just before its expiry

  [Original repo](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store) up to archiving:
- On Android 11, Autofill will use the new [inline autofill](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/ime-autofill#configure-provider) UI that integrates Autofill results into your keyboard app
- Allow doing a merge instead of a rebase when pulling or syncing
- Add support for manually providing TOTP parameters
- Parse extra content as individual fields
- Improve search result filtering logic
- Allow pinning shortcuts directly to the launcher home screen
- Another workaround for SteamGuard's non-standard OTP format
- Allow importing QR code from images
- Add the ability to run garbage collection on the internal Git repository
- Introduce crash reporting backed by Sentry
- TOTP field now shows the remaining time for which it is valid
- Allow customizing the timeout for decrypted password screen
- Allow toggling ASCII armored output

### Fixed

- Auto-dismiss an abandoned password edit dialog after configurable timeout (password copy timeout is used if configured, 60 seconds otherwise) to prevent information leakage
- Initialising an empty cloned non-pass repo is now possible. This led to an app crash before. The repo to be cloned should however already have at least one commit, e. g. an added and removed dummy file
- Fix app crashes due to a `.gpg-id` file containing an invalid or unknown key/user ID. Prompt for re-selecting/re-importing a PGP secret key file
- In case of multi-key encrypted store entries, decryption failed with passphrases for the other PGP IDs that appear below the first entry in the `.gpg-id` file
- The PGP key is now retrieved also for subkey IDs listed in the `.gpg-id` file
- New store entries created in autofill mode were not committed to the Git repo

  [Original repo](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store) up to archiving:
- Pressing the back button in the navigation bar and the one in the toolbar behaved differently
- App shortcuts would never update once the first 4 were set
- Clipboard history now attempts to flush through 35 times rather than 20 to combat increased clipboard history item count in Samsung devices
- .gpg-id file generated by APS did not work with pass CLI
- All but the latest launcher shortcut would have an empty icon
- When prompted to select a GPG key during onboarding, the app would crash if the user did not make a selection in OpenKeychain
- Biometric authentication prompts no longer inexplicably dismiss when an incorrect biometric is entered

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: The option for generating the SSH key pair in the Ed25519 format was removed from APS. It relied on the now deprecated `androidx.security:security-crypto` library to store the private key as an encrypted file in the application's hidden directory. Use one of Android KeyStore native RSA or ECDSA key format options when generating the SSH key pair. Alternatively, an externally generated SSH private key can be imported into the app. Imported SSH private keys can be in any format, including Ed25519, but they should be protected with a passphrase
- **BREAKING**: Non-free variant removed which allowed filling OTP fields with codes sent by SMS
- `.gpg-id` is now initialised with the numeric key ID instead of the user ID (email)
- The code for persistent PGP passphrase caching was rewritten to remove its dependency on the now deprecated `androidx.security:security-crypto` library. It is enabled via Settings --> Passwords --> Unlock Passwords with biometrics. Passphrase caching and unlocking is only possible with biometric authentication (fingerprint), for enhanced security. The new implementation also works with multi-key pass stores.

  [Original repo](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store) up to archiving:
- **BREAKING**: The app's package name has been changed to `app.passwordstore` so users are aware that this is a new project with no compatibility guarantees with Password Store 1.x.y.
- **BREAKING**: Introduce a new PGP backend powered by [PGPainless](https://github.com/pgpainless/pgpainless) which completely replaces OpenKeychain
- **BREAKING**: Accessibility autofill has been removed completely due to being buggy, insecure and lacking in features. Upgrade to Android 8 or preferably later to gain access to our advanced Autofill implementation.
- **BREAKING**: Support for stores outside the hidden app directory has been removed due to technical restrictions, see [this issue](https://github.com/Android-Password-Store/Android-Password-Store/issues/1849) for details.
- **BREAKING**: The app's minimum supported Android version has been raised to Android Oreo (API level 26).
- The settings UI has been completely re-done to dramatically improve discoverability and navigation for users
- Using the `git://` protocol in the server URL now presents an explicit discouragement rather than a generic error
- Encrypted data is no longer ASCII armored, bringing it in line with `pass`
- Changing password generator parameters now automatically updates the password without needing to press the 'Generate' button again
- The app UI was reskinned to match Google's Material You guidelines
- Using HTTPS without authentication is now fully supported, and no longer asks for a username
- Enabling 'Show hidden files and folders' no longer shows Git-related files and folders
- XkPasswd password generator has been removed in favor of one backed by [Diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
- The app no longer prompts for a branch during clone and instead always uses the default one. Use the hard reset option in Git utilities to switch to the desired branch after cloning.
